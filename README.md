 ### Project Description: Automated System Process Logger and Email Notifier

#### Objective
Develop an automated system that logs running processes on a machine, analyzes their usage and performance, and sends notifications via email if any anomalies or predefined thresholds are detected.

#### Components

1. **Process Logger**
   - Periodically logs active processes, CPU usage, memory usage, and other relevant metrics.
   - Stores the logs in a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON, or a database).

2. **Analyzer**
   - Continuously monitors the logged data.
   - Detects anomalies or specific conditions (e.g., high CPU usage, memory leaks, unresponsive processes).
   - Can be configured with custom rules and thresholds for various metrics.

3. **Notifier**
   - Sends email notifications when the Analyzer detects anomalies or breaches thresholds.
   - Configurable email templates and recipients.

#### Detailed Requirements

1. **Process Logger**
   - **Frequency**: Configurable logging interval (e.g., every minute, every 5 minutes).
   - **Metrics**: Process ID, process name, CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network I/O, and status.
   - **Storage**: Option to store logs locally or in a remote database.

2. **Analyzer**
   - **Real-time Analysis**: Analyzes logs as they are created.
   - **Custom Rules**: Users can define custom rules for anomaly detection.
   - **Historical Data**: Ability to analyze trends over time and identify recurring issues.

3. **Notifier**
   - **Email Configuration**: SMTP settings, recipient list, email content.
   - **Notification Triggers**: Customizable triggers based on Analyzer rules.
   - **Retry Mechanism**: Ensures email delivery even if initial attempts fail.

#### Technologies and Tools

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `psutil` for process and system monitoring
  - `smtplib` for sending emails
  - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis
  - `schedule` for task scheduling
- **Database**: SQLite for local storage or any preferred remote database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- **Deployment**: Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS)

#### Implementation Plan

1. **Setup and Configuration**
   - Initialize the project and set up a virtual environment.
   - Install required libraries and dependencies.

2. **Process Logger Module**
   - Implement a function to log active processes and their metrics.
   - Store logs in the chosen format (CSV, JSON, or database).

3. **Analyzer Module**
   - Develop functions to read and analyze logs.
   - Implement custom rule configurations for anomaly detection.

4. **Notifier Module**
   - Set up email configuration and templates.
   - Develop a function to send emails based on triggers from the Analyzer.

5. **Integration**
   - Integrate the Logger, Analyzer, and Notifier modules.
   - Schedule the Logger and Analyzer to run at specified intervals.

6. **Testing**
   - Test each component individually.
   - Perform integration testing to ensure seamless operation.

7. **Deployment and Maintenance**
   - Deploy the system on a target machine.
   - Provide documentation for configuration and usage.
   - Set up maintenance routines for log cleanup and system updates.

#### Potential Enhancements

- **Web Dashboard**: Add a web interface for real-time monitoring and configuration.
- **Machine Learning**: Implement machine learning algorithms for advanced anomaly detection.
- **Notification Channels**: Extend notifications to other channels like SMS or Slack.

This project aims to provide an automated, reliable system for monitoring and maintaining system health, ensuring prompt notification of any issues that may arise.
